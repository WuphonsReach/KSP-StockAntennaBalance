# KSP-StockAntennaBalance

Rebalances the stock KSP 1.2 antennas.

# Goals:

Designed for use with the DSN strength set to 0.10 (1/10th of normal) to 1.00 (normal).
This puts more emphasis on having a good set of satellites around Kerbin and other planetary bodies to relay signals.
Direct connections are much harder to obtain without a relay satellite.

RA-100 Relay Antenna should only be needed for outer planet mods (like RSS, OPM).

# Part changes:

### Direct Antennas

- Communotron 16S -- no changes, only suitable for low Kerbin orbit
- Communotron 16 -- boosted power, suitable for Mun-Kerbin (at DSN level 1)
- Comms DTS-M1 -- nerfed heavily, good for Kerbin sphere-of-influence (SoI)
- Communotron HG-55 -- Can reach back from parts of inner planet orbits with DSN level 2
- Communotron 88-88 -- Can reach back from parts of Duna/Dres orbits with DSN level 3

### Relay Antennas

- HG-5 High Gain Antenna -- 2.5x as powerful as DSN level 1, partial coverage of inner-planets at DSN2
- RA-2 Relay Antenna -- equal to DSN level 2, full coverage of Eve/Moho/Duna when talking to DSN2 or RA-2 at Kerbin
- RA-15 Relay Antenna -- 2x as powerful as DSN level 3, full coverage of Eeloo orbit (but weak) when talking to DSN2/RA-2 at Kerbin
- RA-100 Relay Antenna -- 8x as powerful as DSN level 3, suitable for OPM mod, allows RA-2 to have 64% signal at Eeloo max
