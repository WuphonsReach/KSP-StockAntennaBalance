# KSP-StockAntennaBalance

Rebalances the stock KSP 1.2 antennas.

# Goals:

- Designed for use with the DSN strength set to 0.10 (1/10th of normal) to 1.00 (normal).
- Put more emphasis on having a good set of relay satellites around Kerbin and other planetary bodies.
- Direct connections are much harder to obtain without a relay satellite.
- RA-100 Relay Antenna should only be needed for outer planet mods (like RSS, OPM).
- Relay antennas can be used to augment the tracking station (or DSN) on Kerbin when extra ground stations are disabled in the advanced difficulty options.

# Part changes:

### Direct Antennas

The direct-connect antennas are now more limited in power (and range) so that at lower tech levels,
you really need to use a relay satellite network to get the science and signal back to Kerbin.

- Communotron 16S -- no changes, only suitable for low Kerbin orbit
- Communotron 16 -- boosted power, suitable for Mun-Kerbin (at DSN level 1)
- Comms DTS-M1 -- nerfed heavily, good for Kerbin sphere-of-influence (SoI)
- Communotron HG-55 -- Can reach back from parts of inner planet orbits with DSN level 2
- Communotron 88-88 -- Can reach back from parts of Duna/Dres orbits with DSN level 3

### Relay Antennas

The relay antennas have been boosted in power to be equal or better then the Deep Space Network (DSN) on Kerbin.
This gives better gameplay where the extra ground stations on Kerbin have been disabled.

- HG-5 High Gain Antenna -- 2.5x as powerful as DSN level 1, partial coverage of inner-planets at DSN2
- RA-2 Relay Antenna -- equal to DSN level 2, full coverage of Eve/Moho/Duna when talking to DSN2 or RA-2 at Kerbin
- RA-15 Relay Antenna -- 2x as powerful as DSN level 3, full coverage of Eeloo orbit (but weak) when talking to DSN2/RA-2 at Kerbin
- RA-100 Relay Antenna -- 8x as powerful as DSN level 3, suitable for OPM mod, allows RA-2 to have 64% signal at Eeloo max
