# KSP-StockAntennaBalance
Rebalances the stock KSP 1.2 antennas.

Goals:

Designed for use with the DSN strength set to 0.10 (1/10th of normal).
This puts more emphasis on having a good set of satellites around Kerbin and other planetary bodies to relay signals.
Direct connections are much harder to obtain without a relay satellite.
